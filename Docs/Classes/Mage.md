# Mage Class Guide - WindrunnerRotations

## Overview

Mages are masters of arcane, fire, and frost magic, capable of powerful burst damage, sustained AoE, and unparalleled crowd control. This guide covers all three Mage specializations, with particular focus on how WindrunnerRotations optimizes your gameplay with each spec.

## Specializations

### Arcane

Arcane Mages focus on mana management and Arcane Charge mechanics to deal massive single-target burst damage. They have a unique playstyle that alternates between conserving and spending mana.

### Fire

Fire Mages rely on critical strike chance to proc Hot Streak for instant Pyroblasts, creating a fast-paced and reactive playstyle with strong cleave damage.

### Frost

Frost Mages use procs like Brain Freeze and Fingers of Frost to trigger powerful instant casts while providing exceptional crowd control and survivability.

## Key Resources and Mechanics

### Mana

Mana is the primary resource for Mages, though its importance varies by specialization:

- **Arcane**: Critical resource requiring careful management, directly impacts damage
- **Fire**: Minimal concern in normal rotation
- **Frost**: Minimal concern in normal rotation

### Arcane Charges

Exclusive to Arcane specialization, Arcane Charges:
- Maximum of 4 charges
- Increases damage of Arcane Blast and Arcane Barrage
- Increases mana cost of Arcane Blast
- Generated by Arcane Blast and certain talents
- Consumed by Arcane Barrage or cleared when out of combat

### Procs

Each specialization has unique procs:
- **Arcane**: Clearcasting (free Arcane Blast)
- **Fire**: Hot Streak (instant Pyroblast), Heating Up (single crit)
- **Frost**: Brain Freeze (instant Flurry), Fingers of Frost (instant Ice Lance)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Arcane Mana Issues**:
- Adjust the burn phase mana threshold in WindrunnerRotations settings
- Ensure you're not staying at 4 Arcane Charges during conserve phase
- Verify you're using Evocation at the end of your burn phase

**Fire Proc Chain Breaking**:
- Check your latency; high latency can affect Fire Blast timing
- Ensure you have enough Fire Blast charges available
- Consider adjusting Fire Blast usage priority in settings

**Frost Shatter Combo Timing**:
- Adjust the Shatter combo timing preference in settings
- Try increasing/decreasing latency compensation
- Ensure Brain Freeze procs are being used optimally

### Class-Specific Settings

For optimal performance, make these adjustments in the WindrunnerRotations configuration:

- **Arcane Settings**: Adjust burn phase mana threshold to match your comfort level (30-50%)
- **Fire Settings**: Set AoE threshold to match your content (3 for M+, 4+ for raids)
- **Frost Settings**: Tune Shatter combo timing to your latency and playstyle
- **Cooldown Management**: Choose between aggressive (on cooldown) or conservative (save for key moments) usage

## Arcane Mage Deep Dive

As Arcane is one of the most complex specs to optimize, here's additional guidance on mastering it with WindrunnerRotations:

### Burn and Conserve Phases

Arcane's rotation revolves around alternating between:

**Burn Phase**:
- Occurs when cooldowns are available
- Maximizes damage at the cost of mana
- Maintains 4 Arcane Charges throughout
- Uses all available cooldowns
- Ends with Evocation or when reaching minimum mana threshold

**Conserve Phase**:
- Focuses on mana efficiency
- Typically maintains 1-3 charges, never 4
- Uses Arcane Barrage regularly to reset charges
- Prioritizes Clearcasting procs
- Builds mana for next burn phase

WindrunnerRotations automatically detects and switches between these phases based on your cooldown availability, mana levels, and configured settings.

### Advanced Settings

- **Burn Phase Detection**: Automatically starts burn phase when cooldowns align
- **Burn Phase Mana Threshold**: Customizable minimum mana percentage to end burn phase
- **Charge Management**: Intelligent Arcane Charge handling based on phase
- **Clearcasting Priority**: Options for using Clearcasting on single-target or AoE spells
- **Touch of the Magi Timing**: Optimized usage with other cooldowns

### Arcane Rotation Nuances

WindrunnerRotations handles several nuanced mechanics:

1. **Harmonic Echo**: Optimizes the timing of Arcane Blast after Arcane Barrage to maximize the echo effect
2. **Arcane Harmony**: Stacks and uses Arcane Missiles at optimal stack count
3. **Radiant Spark**: Sequences abilities to maximize the vulnerability windows
4. **Time Anomaly**: Reacts instantly to random procs for maximum benefit
5. **Arcane Bombardment**: Adjusts rotation during execute phase for additional Arcane Barrage damage

## Conclusion

The Mage offers three distinct and powerful specializations with complex mechanics. WindrunnerRotations helps you master these mechanics by automating the optimal usage of abilities while giving you control over key strategic decisions.

# Phase 10: Advanced Ability Control System

Phase 10 introduces a comprehensive Advanced Ability Control System that provides unprecedented customization for interrupts, dispels, and crowd control abilities. This system allows players to fine-tune every aspect of their automated combat abilities with intuitive controls and flexible options.

## Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Delay System
- **Customizable Timing**: Set min/max delay ranges from 0-3 seconds for each ability type
- **Multiple Timing Modes**:
  - Instant (0 delay)
  - Human-like (randomized middle)
  - Random (fully random)
  - Variable (context-aware)
  - Percentage (cast percentage-based)
- **Ability-Specific Overrides**: Configure unique delay settings for individual abilities

### 2. Spell Inclusion/Exclusion System
- **Whitelist & Blacklist**: Precisely control which spells are automatically handled
- **Spell Database**: Built-in database of important interrupts and dangerous debuffs
- **Encounter-Specific Rules**: Special handling for specific dungeon and raid mechanics

### 3. Enhanced Interrupt Logic
- **Spell Priority Awareness**: Save interrupts for high-priority abilities
- **Cast Percentage Targeting**: Interrupt at specific points in enemy casts
- **School Lockout Optimization**: Prioritize interrupts that lock spell schools
- **Party Coordination**: Take turns interrupting with party members

### 4. Advanced Dispel System
- **Type Prioritization**: Individually prioritize Magic, Curse, Disease, Poison, and Enrage effects
- **Safety Thresholds**: Prevent dispelling when target health is too low
- **Stack-Based Logic**: Only dispel at configurable stack thresholds
- **Duration Awareness**: Skip dispelling debuffs about to expire
- **Dangerous Debuff Database**: Instantly dispel critical effects

### 5. Sophisticated Crowd Control
- **CC Type Control**: Individually enable/disable different CC types (stuns, roots, etc.)
- **Diminishing Returns Awareness**: Avoid using CC affected by DR
- **Chain CC Coordination**: Coordinate CC chains with party members
- **Break Prediction**: Intelligent handling of CC likely to break

### 6. Comprehensive UI
- **Tabbed Interface**: Intuitive navigation between different settings categories
- **Visual Delay Controls**: Interactive sliders for precise timing configuration
- **Spell Management**: Search, add, and remove spells from inclusion/exclusion lists
- **Profiles**: Import/export capabilities for sharing configurations

### 7. Performance Tracking
- **Success Rate Monitoring**: Track effectiveness of interrupts, dispels, and CC
- **Timing Distribution**: Analyze and optimize timing patterns
- **Adaptive Optimization**: Optional auto-adjustment based on success patterns

## Integration With Existing Systems

The Advanced Ability Control System integrates seamlessly with other Windrunner Rotations features:

- **Machine Learning**: Uses pattern recognition to improve targeting and timing
- **Party Synergy**: Coordinates interrupts and CC with group members
- **PvP Systems**: Special handling for arena and battleground scenarios
- **External Data**: Imports optimal interrupt priorities from top logs

## Usage

The Advanced Ability Control System can be accessed through:

- **Advanced Settings Panel**: `/wr settings` â†’ "Ability Control" tab
- **Slash Commands**: `/wr abilitycontrol` or `/wr ac` for quick configuration
- **Visual Mode**: Right-click visualization of abilities when in Edit Mode

## Configuration Examples

### Quick Interrupts (PvP Focus)
```
/wr ac interrupt timing instant
/wr ac interrupt priority 2
```

### Human-like Dispels (Anti-Detection)
```
/wr ac dispel timing human
/wr ac dispel delay 0.3 0.7
```

### Selective CC (Mythic+ Focus)
```
/wr ac cc type stun enable
/wr ac cc type fear disable
```

## Implementation Details

The Advanced Ability Control System consists of the following components:

- `Core/AdvancedAbilityControl.lua`: Core system implementation
- `UI/AdvancedAbilityControlUI.lua`: Settings interface
- Comprehensive spell databases for different content types

## Benefits Over Competing Addons

These Phase 10 enhancements provide several advantages over competing rotation addons:

1. **Unparalleled Customization**: No other addon offers this level of detailed control
2. **Content-Aware Behavior**: Adapts automatically to different content types
3. **Group Coordination**: Intelligent party awareness prevents overlap and optimizes coverage
4. **Performance Analysis**: Built-in tracking helps identify and improve weak points
5. **Natural Timing**: Sophisticated delay systems appear more natural in gameplay

This feature elevates Windrunner Rotations from a simple rotation helper to a comprehensive combat assistant that handles even the most complex decision-making aspects of gameplay.

# Phase 6: Community Integration & Advanced Learning

## Overview

Phase 6 of Windrunner Rotations introduces advanced features that take the addon to the next level:

1. **Community Integration**: Connect with the Windrunner community, share profiles, access leaderboards, and contribute to the addon's development.

2. **Advanced Learning System**: An AI-driven system that adapts rotations based on your performance, learning to optimize ability usage for your specific playstyle and gear.

## Community Module Features

The new Community module (`Core/Community.lua`) provides:

- **Profile Sharing**: Share your optimized rotation profiles with other players and download top-rated profiles from the community.
- **Leaderboards**: Track performance metrics across the community and see how your performance compares with others.
- **Guides Repository**: Access user-created guides and contribute your own expertise.
- **Issue Reporting**: Easily report bugs and suggest improvements through an in-game interface.
- **Community Announcements**: Stay updated with the latest addon developments and upcoming features.
- **Discord Integration**: Connect with the community through Discord for real-time discussions and help.

## Learning System Features

The Learning System module (`Core/LearningSystem.lua`) provides:

- **Adaptive Rotations**: Rotation priorities adapt based on your performance data, optimizing over time for your specific playstyle.
- **Performance Analysis**: Tracks ability effectiveness, success rates, damage output, and resource usage to build a comprehensive performance model.
- **Intelligent Rules**: Automatically derives optimization rules for different combat scenarios (single target, multi-target, execute phase, etc.).
- **Sequence Optimization**: Identifies optimal spell sequences that work especially well together.
- **User-Controlled Learning**: Configure how aggressively the system learns and adapts, with options to reset or fine-tune the learning process.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track how the learning system is improving your performance over time.

## Getting Started with Phase 6

### Community Features

Use `/wr community` to access community features and explore the various sections:

- **Home**: Overview of community status, announcements, and featured profiles
- **Profiles**: Browse, download, and share rotation profiles
- **Guides**: Access player-created guides and tutorials
- **Leaderboards**: See top performers in various categories
- **Resources**: Find helpful resources and links
- **Settings**: Configure your community preferences

### Learning System

Use `/wr learning` to access learning system features and configuration:

- **Statistics**: View learning progress and performance statistics
- **Weights**: See how the system has weighted different abilities based on your performance
- **Rules**: View the adaptive rules derived from your combat performance
- **Reset**: Reset learning data to start fresh
- **Config**: Configure learning rate, adaptation behavior, and other settings

## Integration with Core Systems

Phase 6 integrates with existing systems:

- **Profile Manager**: Community-shared profiles work with the existing profile system
- **Rotation System**: Learning system modifies ability priorities through the existing API
- **UI**: New interfaces maintain the same look and feel as existing UI components
- **Analytics**: Performance data is shared with analytics for comprehensive tracking

## Technical Implementation

For developers and advanced users, here's how the new systems work:

- **Learning Algorithm**: Uses a reinforcement learning approach with weighted ability scores and contextual rules
- **API Integration**: Community features connect to a central API server for sharing and synchronization
- **Local Storage**: Learning data is saved locally for each character and specialization
- **Event Handling**: Both systems respond to relevant game events for real-time adaptation and synchronization

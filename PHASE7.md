# Phase 7: Performance & Stability Enhancement

## Overview

Phase 7 of Windrunner Rotations focuses on improving two critical aspects that were identified as potential weak points compared to established addons like Phoenix Rotations:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Implementing advanced techniques to ensure the addon runs efficiently with minimal system impact, even on lower-end computers.

2. **Stability Enhancement**: Creating robust error handling, recovery mechanisms, and safeguards to ensure the addon remains functional even when encountering issues.

## Performance Optimizer Features

The new PerformanceOptimizer module (`Core/PerformanceOptimizer.lua`) provides a comprehensive system for monitoring and improving addon performance:

### Adaptive Performance Management
- **Dynamic Update Frequency**: Automatically adjusts how often the addon updates based on current system performance
- **Processing Time Limits**: Ensures no single operation takes too long and causes framerate drops
- **Combat Mode**: Special high-performance mode automatically activates during combat

### Intelligent Resource Usage
- **Memory Management**: Automatically monitors and controls memory usage
- **Garbage Collection**: Strategic garbage collection to prevent memory bloat
- **Function Caching**: Caches results of expensive calculations to prevent redundant processing

### Advanced Optimization Techniques
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Automatically identifies and addresses performance bottlenecks
- **Function Throttling**: Limits how often CPU-intensive functions can run
- **Processing Limits**: Caps the amount of time spent on non-critical operations

### Performance Monitoring
- **Detailed Metrics**: Tracks CPU usage, memory consumption, and update times
- **Module Analysis**: Identifies which parts of the addon are using the most resources
- **Visualization Tools**: Graphical display of performance metrics for easy monitoring

## Stability Manager Features

The StabilityManager module (`Core/StabilityManager.lua`) provides comprehensive protection against errors and instability:

### Error Prevention & Recovery
- **Error Detection**: Sophisticated error tracking and analysis
- **Automated Recovery**: Attempts to automatically recover from errors without user intervention
- **Safe Mode**: Falls back to a simplified, stable mode when serious issues are detected

### Self-Healing Systems
- **Module Isolation**: Identifies and isolates problematic modules to prevent cascade failures
- **State Backups**: Maintains backups of critical module states for recovery
- **Watchdog Timer**: Detects and recovers from complete stalls or freezes

### Safety Systems
- **Critical Function Protection**: Wraps essential functions in error-catching code
- **Safety Checks**: Regular verification of addon integrity and functionality
- **Stall Detection**: Identifies UI freezes and takes corrective action

### Diagnostic Tools
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive logging of errors with context information
- **Module Analysis**: Monitors the health and performance of each addon component
- **Recovery Statistics**: Tracks successful and failed recovery attempts

## Benefits Over Previous Implementations

These new systems provide several key advantages compared to both earlier phases of Windrunner Rotations and competing addons:

1. **Resilience**: The addon can now recover from many types of errors that would cause other addons to fail completely

2. **Consistency**: Performance is more predictable across different hardware and situations

3. **Adaptability**: The addon automatically adjusts to the user's system capabilities

4. **Transparency**: Users can see exactly what's happening with performance and stability

5. **Protection**: Critical functionality is guarded against failures in non-essential systems

## Usage

### Performance Tools
- Use `/wr performance` to access performance monitoring and optimization tools
- The Performance UI provides detailed metrics and optimization controls
- The system works automatically by default, but can be fine-tuned through settings

### Stability Tools
- Use `/wr stability` to access stability features and error reports
- The Stability UI shows error history, module status, and recovery options
- Error recovery happens automatically by default but can be configured

## Technical Implementation

For developers and advanced users:

- **Memory Profiling**: Uses statistical sampling to identify memory usage patterns
- **CPU Profiling**: Traces function calls to identify expensive operations
- **Recovery Strategies**: Multi-layered approach with fallbacks for critical failures
- **Error Correlation**: Identifies patterns in seemingly unrelated errors
- **Module Dependencies**: Tracks inter-module dependencies to prevent cascade failures

# Phase 9: Advanced Rotation Optimization and Specialization

## Overview

Phase 9 represents a significant leap forward in the capabilities of Windrunner Rotations, focusing on advanced optimization techniques, specialized UI elements, and sophisticated adaptation mechanisms. The primary goal of this phase is to create a rotation system that not only executes optimal rotations but actively learns and adapts to each player's unique situations, playstyle, and environment.

This phase introduces eight major enhancement areas:
1. Machine Learning
2. PvP Support
3. Class Visualization
4. Party Synergy
5. SimulationCraft Integration
6. Adaptive Difficulty
7. Alt Awareness
8. External Data Integration

- **Personalization**: Learns individual player patterns and preferences

### Implementation Details:
- Historical combat tracking with advanced metrics
- Resource generation/consumption modeling
- Weighted scoring of ability sequences
- Situation-specific rule determination
- Separation of global and personal patterns

### Commands:
- `/wr ml status` - Shows current machine learning status

## 2. PvP Support (Core/PvPSystem.lua)

The PvP System module provides specialized rotation adaptations for Player vs. Player combat scenarios.

### Key Features:
- **Specialized PvP Rotations**: Optimized ability priorities for arena and battleground situations
- **Enemy Awareness**: Tracks enemy cooldowns, CC diminishing returns, and burst windows
- **Defensive Reaction**: Automatically suggests defensive abilities when in danger
- **CC Chain Management**: Optimizes crowd control timing and target selection
- **Target Priority System**: Identifies optimal targets (e.g., enemy healers) with kill windows

### Implementation Details:
- Comprehensive enemy tracking system
- Diminishing returns calculation for all CC types
- Threat assessment for enemy players
- Burst window detection and response
- Role-based targeting priorities

### Commands:
- `/wr pvp status` - Shows current PvP status
- `/wr pvp enable/disable` - Toggles PvP optimization
- `/wr pvp enemies` - Shows tracked enemy information
- `/wr pvp target` - Shows detailed information about current target

## 3. Class-Specific Visualization (UI/ClassSpecificUI.lua)

This module provides specialized UI elements tailored to each class's unique resources and mechanics.

### Key Features:
- **Class-Specific Resource Display**: Visually optimized for each resource type (Combo Points, Runes, Soul Shards, etc.)
- **DoT/HoT Tracking**: Visual timeline of damage/healing over time effects with pandemic windows
- **Proc Visualization**: Prominent display of important ability procs with audio cues
- **APM Metrics**: Real-time Actions Per Minute tracking with class-specific benchmarks
- **Spell Queue Display**: Shows next 3-5 recommended abilities in sequence

### Implementation Details:
- Custom animations for resource changes
- Color-coded status indicators
- Animated proc alerts with sound integration
- Class-themed visual elements
- Responsive and scalable UI framework

### Commands:
- `/wr classui` - Toggles class-specific UI
- `/wr classui scale <value>` - Sets UI scale
- `/wr classui feature <name> <on/off>` - Toggles specific features

## 4. Resource Forecasting (UI/ResourceForecast.lua)

This module provides advanced visualization and prediction of resource generation and consumption.

### Key Features:
- **Resource Timeline**: Visual graph showing predicted resource levels over time
- **Ability Impact Visualization**: Shows how upcoming abilities will affect resources
- **Optimal Usage Windows**: Identifies optimal times for resource-intensive abilities
- **History Tracking**: Shows recent resource fluctuations for comparison
- **Class-Specific Calculations**: Accounts for class mechanics in predictions

### Implementation Details:
- Real-time resource state monitoring
- Formula-based prediction algorithms
- Ability resource cost/generation database
- Interactive graph with detailed tooltips
- Advanced regeneration modeling

### Commands:
- `/wr forecast` - Toggles resource forecast display
- `/wr forecast scale <value>` - Sets display scale
- `/wr forecast option <name> <value>` - Configures display options

## 5. Planned Future Enhancements

The following systems are planned for future development:

### 5.1 Party Synergy
- Cooldown coordination with party members
- Buff/debuff gap detection
- Complementary ability timing
- Role-based rotation adaptations

### 5.2 SimulationCraft Integration
- Direct APL imports from SimC
- Real-time APL execution
- Differential analysis against SimC recommendations
- Custom APL editing

### 5.3 Adaptive Difficulty Scaling
- Automatic complexity adjustment
- Guided learning mode
- Mistake detection and correction
- Progressive feature unlocking

### 5.4 Alt Character Awareness
- Account-wide learning transfer
- Class knowledge cross-pollination
- Comparative performance metrics
- Quick-swap profiles

### 5.5 External Combat Data Integration
- WarcraftLogs integration
- Recommendation engine based on top logs
- Post-fight analysis
- Real-time percentile tracking

## Implementation Status

Phase 9 currently includes:
- ✅ Machine Learning System (MachineLearning.lua)
- ✅ PvP Support System (PvPSystem.lua)
- ✅ Class-Specific UI (ClassSpecificUI.lua)
- ✅ Resource Forecasting (ResourceForecast.lua)
- ✅ Party Synergy System (PartySynergy.lua)
- ✅ External Combat Data Integration (ExternalDataIntegration.lua)
- ✅ Advanced UI Customization (AdvancedSettingsUI.lua, VisualEditMode.lua, GuidedLearning.lua)

All main Phase 9 features have been implemented successfully.

## Usage

Phase 9 features are accessible through the following slash commands:

- `/wr ml` - Machine Learning commands
- `/wr pvp` - PvP System commands
- `/wr classui` - Toggle Class-Specific UI
- `/wr forecast` - Toggle Resource Forecast
- `/wr synergy` - Party Synergy System
- `/wr external` - External Combat Data Integration

## Benefits Over Competing Addons

These Phase 9 enhancements provide several advantages over competing rotation addons:

1. **Continuous Improvement**: Unlike static rotation systems, our ML-powered rotations improve over time
2. **Personalized Experience**: Adapts to each player's unique playstyle and performance
3. **Context-Aware Decisions**: Makes intelligent decisions based on the full combat context
4. **PvP Excellence**: Superior performance in PvP scenarios where other addons typically struggle
5. **Rich Visual Feedback**: Class-specific UI provides intuitive understanding of complex mechanics
6. **Resource Optimization**: Advanced forecasting prevents resource waste and optimizes usage timing
7. **Group Synergy**: Coordinates cooldowns and tactical decisions with party/raid members
8. **Data-Driven Optimization**: Integrates with external sources like WarcraftLogs for optimal setups
9. **Comprehensive Customization**: Allows users to tailor every aspect of the UI to their preferences
10. **Guided Learning**: Helps users master all features through interactive tutorials

These features collectively create a rotation assistant that not only performs optimally but actively helps players improve their own understanding and skill while providing extensive customization options and data integration.

Alright, you're talking next-level AI automation—building an elite combat rotation system + control UI + dungeon support + class-based profiles, smarter and more advanced than anything out there like Phoenix Rotation, Murloc, or Angry Panda.

If you're instructing your AI coder (or agent) to execute this project, here's how you should phrase it, broken into clear, powerful goals.

✅ Full Instruction Plan for Your AI Coder
Project Name: Ultimate WoW AI Combat System – “All-in-One Rotation Engine”

📚 1. Knowledge Gathering and Learning
“Start by collecting full documentation and references from the following sources:

Tinkr API & Lua bindings: Review all available modules, functions, and features from Tinkr documentation and codebase.

Class Knowledgebase: Collect all class mechanics, spells, rotations, talents, cooldowns, and PvE roles from:

https://www.wowhead.com/guides/classes

https://www.wowhead.com/guide/the-war-within/season-2-overview

Parse top builds, talents, and priority lists for each spec in War Within Season 2 (Retail).

Organize the data per class/spec in structured format (JSON or Lua tables).”

⚙️ 2. Rotation System (AI-Powered)
“For each class/spec:

Build a fully automated rotation system that adapts in real time based on:

Target health

Player movement

Buffs/debuffs

Cooldowns

Crowd control

AoE vs Single Target

Use intelligent priority logic (inspired by SimulationCraft and real-time combat logs).

Optimize for max DPS or HPS depending on the role.

Include interrupt management, defensive cooldown usage, and healing logic.”

🧠 3. Profile System
“Create a profile manager:

Each class/spec should have its own profile with editable rotation settings.

Allow per-dungeon or per-boss customization.

Profiles should be exportable/importable.”

🧩 4. Full Dungeon + Raid Support
“Add full support for all War Within Season 2 dungeons and encounters:

Include boss mechanics, interrupt priorities, adds, movement phases.

Add toggles to switch behavior based on dungeon affixes.

Include a dungeon module loader to auto-switch rotation profiles.”

🎮 5. User Interface (UI)
“Build a sleek, fully integrated UI with:

Class selector and spec-based color themes

Rotation preview window (graphical or icon-based)

Real-time combat log parsing

Toggle buttons (Interrupts, AoE, Defensives, Cooldowns)

Profile editor

Dungeon-aware behavior settings

UI should be more intuitive, dynamic, and responsive than Phoenix Rotation, with full in-game customization, anchored windows, and tooltips.”

🌐 6. Smart Features
“Integrate the following features:

Real-time GCD and cooldown management

Spell queue system with predictive casting

Smart target switching for AoE

Pause/Resume keybind

Auto targeting

Smart movement detection

Keybind-safe system with secure buttons (to comply with TOS)”

🔄 7. Continuous Updates
“Include automatic version check and updater. Design the architecture to support easy patching and updating per WoW patch/season changes.”

📣 Final Command You Can Say to Your AI Assistant:
“Build a fully automated, AI-based combat rotation addon for WoW Retail (The War Within - Season 2), using Tinkr and based on data from Wowhead.

It should:

Include all classes/specs with dynamic profiles.

Feature better performance and customization than Phoenix Rotation.

Have a powerful, intuitive UI.

Support dungeons, raids, and boss-specific logic.

Get all spell data, talents, and encounter info from Wowhead and structure everything modularly for updates. This should be the most complete and advanced rotation engine addon ever created.”

## Legal Note

Please ensure you have the proper rights to use any assets you include in your project. Blizzard generally allows fan projects to use their assets in a non-commercial context, but it's always best to review their current [fan art policy](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal/fan-development-policy).
